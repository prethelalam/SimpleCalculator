# SimpleCalculator
This is a simple calculator I built using Java in the IDE Eclipse and VS Code

# Reflection

## Introduction/Purpose:
I utilzied a text editor called VS code and an IDE called eclipse to build a simple calculator. The purpose of this calculator is to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, sqaure roots, exponents, and converting decimals into percentages. I learned how to program all of these mathematical operations while also learning about if statements, else if statements, functions, while loops, and boolean expressions. Moreover, I learned how to convert specfic data types into different data types (such as converting a string into a double or integer). 

## Conclusion:
I will use the knowledge I have acquired to build more applications that utilize mathmatical operations. Moreover, I will dedicate more time in improving how to write my code better to ensure readability.
